the ability to report non-emergencies to UCSC facilities and the UCSC Police 
Department through text, photo, video, and location services. Also provides

enforcement such as police bulletins, lost-and-found announcements, produced 
educational videos, and more.

Web application allowing facilities and police users to receive and respond 
to incoming reports sent by mobile application users. Provides thorough tools 
allowing for the data analysis of past reports as well as the ability to link, 
compile, and forward reports according to user demand. Features varying levels 
of user privileges with secure login in cooperation with university information 
technology technicians.

Both mobile and web applications will require Shibboleth login to ensure only
