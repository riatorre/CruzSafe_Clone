This directory is for learning projects for the various technologies that will be used in the development of this project. Each member of the team should have committed something for each of the technologies they are learning for the first sprint, which may include the following;

React 		(10 hours of work)
Firebase 	(3 hours of work)
JavaScript 	(1 hour of work)
CSS 		(4 hours of work)
HTML 		(0.5 hours of work)
Node.js 	(3 hours of work)

Please use your own discretion and judgement as to how extensively you wish to study each technology, and what sort of product you will push to the directory by the end of the sprint. It's all up in the air for this sprint. Go google some stuff and have fun!
