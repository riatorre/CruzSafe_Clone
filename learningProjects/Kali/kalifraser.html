<p align="LEFT">My name is Kalinda "Kali" Fraser. I aspire to help the world with my work and innovations. For now, though, I'm busy learning as much as I can in my last two quarters in Computer Science at UC Santa Cruz.</p>

<p align="LEFT">Since starting at UCSC, I have found an affinity for coding, and have gained considerable experience in Java and C programming. I also have some experience with Python, assembly language, and using git and Matlab, as well as basic web design.</p>

<p align="LEFT">As an endlessly curious person, I have developed a wide range of hobbies, not all of which I have the desired time to pursue. As well as amateur radio, I am fascinated with strategy games (and have been an enthusiastic and
