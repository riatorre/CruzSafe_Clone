            <p>A fantastic hobby I feel that anyone should enjoy (and that not enough people do). You can do so much while sleeping! Like...zzz...</p>

            <h2>Guitar</h2>
            <p>If I didn't have my guitar with me through college, I think I'd have... well, I'd have picked up a different instrument. 
                There's nothing quite like a few hours alone with 6-strings. And preferably an instrument attached to them.</p>

            <h2>Literature</h2>
            <p>Whoever came up with the idea of 'fiction' was a genius, because this stuff is amazing to me. There's nothing quite like the rich romanticization of human existence into 
                neat little bundles of paper (or bytes, as the case might be) wherein characters grow and develop in riveting ways right in front of the reader's eyes.

            <h2>Video Games</h2>
            <p>Nowadays the only video games I play are narrative ones where I can sit down and immerse myself in a different world and with unique, memorable characters. 
                Interactive novels, so to speak. I can always trust on one of them to help me relax after a day of work.</p>

            <h2>Tech Work</h2>
            <p>Busting out the tools and working on anything that isn't up to your own personal specifications is a great feeling. What isn't such a great feeling is either 
                breaking something fragile or losing a tiny, tiny spring and spending 30 minutes looking for it before giving up. I digress.</p>

        <div id="running">
            <h2>Running</h2>
            <p>Sometimes it's liberating to just say screw it and run when you're supposed to walk. The feeling of wind in your face and your feet 
                pounding on the ground is worth the crushing exhaustion and the possibility of injury, I think.</p>

        <div id="airsoft">
            <h2>Airsoft</h2>
            <p>A niche sport with a tight-knit, ridiculously friendly community. One that subjects the participant to all matter of strenuous phsycial activity as well as a heck of a lot of fun. 
                It's not a good weekend unless there's some airsofting in there somewhere, I'd say.</p>

            <h2>Cooking</h2>
            <p>I could either eat the same thing forever and ever more or I could try something new every meal. Given the time and the funds, 
                I'll happily try out something new... and normally completely screw it up. But that's fine. I'm not picky.</p>

            <p>I'm outta ideas and I have a CMPS 130 midterm to study for, unfortunately, so imana have to cut this list short. I think I got the major ones, though. ...Oh yeah. I like to code too. But that's kinda obvious.</p>
