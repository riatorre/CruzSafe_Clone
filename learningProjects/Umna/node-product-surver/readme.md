Go inside node-product-surver folder and run 
- npm install         /// to install all the require models 
- node index.js      /// to run the node file 
- http://localhost:4600/student     /// go to this port to see all the SQL database 
    - What you are seeing here is an Express server running at port 4600 which fetches data from SQL database.
