To look through the student table from the database use the following commands 
Go inside node-product-surver folder and run 
- npm install         /// to install all the require models 
- node index.js      /// to run the node file 
- http://localhost:4600/student     /// go to this port to see all the SQL database 
    - What you are seeing here is an Express server running at port 4600 which fetches data from SQL database.




In order to run the react you must have the above server running to read the mySQL database and the following commands
- npm install      /// to install all the require models 
- yarn start       /// to run the file 
- http://localhost:3000/    /// go to this port to see the output from react along the list of all the sql data base  

â€” If you need help running this. I can show you how I did It on my laptop :)
